In 2014, there was a data breach in the yahoo users database. It wasn't until 2016 that the fbi fully understood how huge the breach actually was. They were able to breach using a 'spear-phishing' email that only needed one click to get into everything. Yahoo has been criticized for the lack of security on their databases. There was a lot that went on but eventually yahoo was bought out by verizon where they inherited their better security.
